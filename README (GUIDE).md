This network meta-analysis were perfomed using both frequentist and bayesian models with DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model

The efficacy outcomes are divided into primary (total hospital stays and mortality rate) and secondary (total fluid input, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, Na, K, Hemoglobin, lactate, bicarbonate, and pH) outcomes

All summary of pairwise, frequentist, and bayesian methods can be accessed through [1. Primary Outcomes] and [2. Secondary Outcomes] folder.

All network meta-analysis plot including:
1. Network graph
2. forest plot of frequentist network meta-analysis
3. pairwise forest plot
4. funnel plot
5. netsplit forest plot
6. netheat plot
7. evidence proportion plot
8. per comparison contribution
9. per study contribution
10. rob chart
11. indirectness chart
12. league table

Safety analysis was conducted in meta-proportion using GLMM (Generalized Linear Mixed model)
Guidance to read the forest plot can be accessed in the [README (Guide to read the plot)] in [Meta-proportion of safety analysis] Folder
